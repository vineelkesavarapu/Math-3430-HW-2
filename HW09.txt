Question 01) Recently we discussed floating point arithmetic, which has become
the standard way of representing numbers on a computer. One of the key aspects
of floating point numbers is that the gap between a number and it's floating
point representation increases with the magnitude of the number. 
This differs from what is called a "fixed
point" representation, where the gap is constant. 

What is an advantage or disadvantage to using floating point instead of fixed
point?
In floating point number systems, decimals are stored seperately from digits.
The gaps between the adjecent numbers are determined by the size of their representations.
Floating points also have A floating point also has advantages over an integer. It is able
to represent values between integers. It is also able to represent a much broader range of 
values due to the scaling factor.
