For this homework you will not need to write any code. Instead you will write a
short paragraph answering the below question. You will save this paragraph in a
textfile called HW10 and upload it to your github repo.


Question 01)

Briefly describe a computing project you would find interesting to work on in
the future. This project may be

1) Implementing existing mathematics as algorithms, as we have done in this
course.

2) A simple project to learn another computing language.

3) An addition to the linear algebra package from your final project. 

4) A project to learn more complex tools in python. (Such as numpy, scipy,
pandas, machine learning packages such as tensorflow, etc...)

5) A computer application (such as a video game, art tools, music editor, etc..)

6) Any other type of project which I have failed to mention here. 

I would want to work on a computer application because I want to create a video game.
The video games I would like to create involves basketball and football. I want to
create an NBA 2K and Madden game that use to make the game fun when I played it as
a kid. The thing I would change in the Madden game is to make fumbles harder to come
by as in recent Madden games fumbles are easy to come by. In NBA 2K, I would change
the shot meter because the NBA 2K21 shot meter game made me mad and it is boring to
play.


Your answer does not need to be exceptionally detailed. Just a short paragraph.
